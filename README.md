White line indicates shortest path.
Red lines are represantation of pheromone trails, changing their opacity accordingly to the amount of pheromones between points.

Later on, inspired by Sebastian Lague's work (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A&t=482s) I started simulating behaviour of ants. 
Ants after leaving nest drop white pheromones searching randomly for food, when they find source of food (red dots), they will start heading home - following white pheromone trail while simultanously leaving red pheromones behind.
New ants will be then "recruited" to follow pheromone trail.
